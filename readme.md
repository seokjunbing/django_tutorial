# Agora group 1
###### (Juan C. Torres, Seok Jun Bing, Odon Orzsik)

## Django tutorial
The tutorial covers the basics of building a blog platform. It has functions to register new users, add posts, and edit posts. We believe that this tutorial is relevant to our Agora project because both rely on being able to create a posting on a website at their fundamental level.

### What we did
We did the tutorial on [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/), which walks over Django in general. It goes over command line utilities (such as `manage.py`) and various aspects of a Django application, such as infrastructure (views, models, how urls are resolved), how to query objects using a sqlite database. It also covers how to add static files such as stylesheets, and goes a bit into forms.

Our website is live [here](http://djangotutorial.pythonanywhere.com/).

### What’s next
Although django has a template language, we think it is extremely limited and plan to use Angular.js for the frontend, and those working on the front-end will have to learn this.
We also plan to use a postgresql database for easier full-text search at the beginning before delving deeper into the search functionality of our site.

### What didn’t work

We have been trying some django/angular.js/heroku boilerplates to have some references and examples and we have not been able to set up some of the environment/dependencies. We are still working on it.
